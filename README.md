# MERN Starter Template

This template creates the boilerplate code for a full stack MERN app and helps developers start working on their projects more quickly.

### Development

MERN-Starter requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run. Tested on version `16.14.2`

This App uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) Node Package Manager to manage its dependencies and packages.

from the **Root** directory

```
$ npm install
```

This will install dependencies for the front end and backend simultaneously as I have configured [Workspaces] to define the `client` and `server` directories.

### Server environment variables

---

Create a .env file in the server folder and add your values.

For example:

```
 NODE_ENV=development
 PORT=3001
 DB_URI=YOUR_OWN_MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
 API_URL=/api
 JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h
 ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN=4d
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=testinggg
 REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=10d
 REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET
 JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET
 APP_NAME="WHATEVER_YOUR_APP_NAME_IS"
```

### Client environment variables

---

```
VITE_BASE_API="/api"
VITE_APP_NAME="WHATEVER_YOUR_APP_NAME_IS"
```

All Vite environment variables must start with `VITE_` unlike `Create-React-App`, which must start with `REACT_APP` I have set up a `constants.js` file in `client/src/client/config` that exports environment variables, for example `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_API`. Notice how Vite used `import.meta.env` instead of `process.env`.

### Starting up the App

---

This App uses [concurrently] to start both the client and server. I have configured the root `package.json` to define workspaces with the client and server. So in the ROOT directory:

```
$ npm start
```

This will start your `client` on `http://localhost:5173/` and backend in development mode on `http://localhost:3001/`, with the server listening on `PORT` 3001.

## Features

- Login and Register
- Authentication using refresh and access tokens
- Rate Limiter to limit the rate an endpoint can be accessed.
- Custom Error handling
- Custom Logger to Log events and errors to your server

- More to be added as we develop

## Tech Stack

### **Front-end**

- [Vite] - A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

- [React] - JavaScript frontend library.

- [Vitest] - Vitest is a testing library for Vite, a modern development build tool for JavaScript applications. It is designed to work seamlessly with Vite's fast and efficient development workflow, providing a convenient way to run tests in Vite projects.

### **Back-end**

---

- [Mongoose] - Mongoose is an object modeling tool for MongoDB and Node.js.

- [Node.js] - Cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a backend JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

- [Express] - Express.js, or simply Express, is a backend web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js

- [MongoDB] - MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that allows you to quickly deploy, scale, and operate MongoDB databases in the cloud.

### **Testing**

---

Testing your application is very important to ensure it is running as expected and as a user would interact with it without breaking and encountering bugs. I have set up [Vitest] in the client, and there is a `__tests__` directory in the `src/client` directory. Simply running `npm test` from the client directory will run all the files with `.tests` in their extension. I have configured some starter tests that test that the `Register` and `Login` display inputs and simulate a user typing into an input that changes its value. Feel free to add your tests as your application grows.

Feel free to put your `.tests` closer to the components you are testing. They don't _have_ to all go in the `__tests__` directory.

I plan to add server-side testing as I build out this template.
